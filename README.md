# GPT from scratch
GPT implementation following Karpathy's lesson https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY

# Setup
You only need a GPU and pytorch. Easiest way is to [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/uxiost/gpt-from-scratch/blob/main/notebooks/gpt_main.ipynb) Remember to Runtime -> Change runtime type -> GPU

Locally you can:  
- Clone repo
- Install requirements > pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run > python gpt.py

# Output sample
After training for 5000 steps in the Shakespeare corpus, we reach a validation loss around 1.49. Generated samples look like this:

```

And then greeting, give me for conclured,
Caming arms the lives-gace; and migh would strike it.

Return no received to speak a brieaty and
On one tender bothers at I keep that heart; honour

GLOUCESTER:
God, then, girl; and say King Lewis manymen:
My boy light are command now to London the rottemphs:
Plantagenet, what Bianca directions,
And did fetch my soldiers; my love of peace
Which with honour coming suss dishonourse,
And slaughter his despate; and ha?
